## Description

> This side quest is an edited version of week 4 example 5 code shown in class.
> The edited version allows the player to move through platforms and obstacles to acheive a goal (collect the star) and advance to the next level.
> As the player advances through each level, the levels get harder (Level 2 has more platforms, level 3 has shorter platforms and lower gravity which makes navigation harder).
> After level 3, the game finishes and the player is able to restart.
