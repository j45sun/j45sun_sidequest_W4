## Description

> This side quest is an edited version of example 3 of the "breathing blob" code shown in class.
> The edited version shows how the blob can be represented as the emotion "panic".
> The blob's "breathing" is unstable and spikes occasionally, the colours are changing between colours that represent anxiety, and the background resembles TV static to represent a panicked state.
